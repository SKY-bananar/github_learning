i want use SwinUnet to run the Openkbp task, but it seems not fit for all the task of medical image, 
i cant directly use the model of 3dTransUnet, because it needs too much memory(nnUnet)

so, the best way it add a transformer block at the bottom of the base Unet

Here's a general approach on how you can do it:

1.Choose a Transformer Model: First, you need to choose a suitable transformer model. The original transformer model from the "Attention is All You Need" paper is a good starting point, but there are also many variants that might be more suitable for your specific task. For example, the Vision Transformer (ViT) is specifically designed for image data.

2.Modify the U-Net Architecture: You need to modify the U-Net architecture to include the transformer. One way to do this is to replace the bottom of the U-Net (i.e., the part of the network that processes the most downsampled features) with the transformer. This allows the transformer to process the most abstract and high-level features, which can be beneficial for capturing long-range dependencies.

3.Combine the Outputs: After the transformer has processed the features, you need to combine its output with the rest of the U-Net. One way to do this is to use skip connections, similar to how they are used in the original U-Net. This allows the network to use both local features from the earlier layers and global features from the transformer.

Here's a rough example of how you can modify the BaseUNet class to include a transformer:

class BaseUNet(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, in_ch, list_ch, transformer):
        super(BaseUNet, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = Encoder(in_ch, list_ch)
        self.transformer = transformer
        self.decoder = Decoder(list_ch)

        # init
        self.initialize()

    # ... rest of the class ...

    def forward(self, x):
        out_encoder = self.encoder(x)
        out_transformer = self.transformer(out_encoder[-1])
        out_decoder = self.decoder(out_encoder[:-1] + [out_transformer])

        return out_decoder

In this example, transformer is an instance of your chosen transformer model. The transformer processes the output of the last encoder layer, and its output is then passed to the decoder.

Please note that this is a very general approach and might need to be adjusted depending on your specific task and the transformer model you are using. For example, if your transformer expects a certain input shape, you might need to reshape the encoder output accordingly.
